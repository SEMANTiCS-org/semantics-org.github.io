# Guidelines for reviewing and reproducibility
Papers submitted to the Research and Innovation track will be evaluated according to the following criteria:
* Appropriateness
* Originality, novelty, and innovativeness
* Impact of results
* Soundness of the evaluation
* Proper comparison to related work
* Clarity and quality of writing
* Reproducibility of results and resources

While we will adopt a double-blind peer review process, reviewers **can decide to disclose their identity** by signing their reviews. In this case, we suggest accompanying the reviewer’s name with one of its persistent identifiers (e.g. ORCID). 

The text of all the reviews (excluding final recommendations) of all the accepted papers will be posted on the conference website with the basic bibliographic metadata of the reviewed submission (i.e. title and authors), and it will be archived on Zenodo as publicly available material. All the reviews of accepted papers that reviewers have signed will be licensed using a [Creative Commons Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license (CC-BY, the copyright holder will be the reviewer). A [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) waiver will accompany the text of the other anonymous reviews of accepted papers.

To enable the publication of the review text and following some shared guidelines such as those introduced in the Publish Your Review initiative (https://asapbio.org/publishyourreviews), we ask the reviewers to make sure that **the text of the review does not reveal any confidential information**, such as mentions of the conference (i.e. SEMANTiCS 2023) at which the submission was under review and the final recommendation and score for acceptance/rejection (that should be specified in specific fields of the review form, not in the review text).

Each review must be prepared according to the **FAST principles for reviewing** (described at https://asapbio.org/fast-principles-for-preprint-feedback): 
* **Focussed** – focus on the content of the paper, focus on the science and not the conference venue, and focus on the science and not the personal;
* **Appropriate** – polish the tone, reflect on the possible bias, engage in scientific discourse, and behave responsibly and with integrity;
* **Specific** – make it useful, indicate if critical or optional, assess whether claims are supported by the data, and be candid;
* **Transparent** – sign (or not) your review, acknowledge oversights, and credit contributors.

A description of such principles with (positive and negative) examples is available at https://asapbio.org/fast-principles-for-preprint-feedback.

A particular focus must be given to the **availability of all relevant materials that are necessary to reproduce the outcomes** described in the submission. Such materials should be made available as proper entities archived in appropriate repositories to guarantee their availability in the long term, a necessary condition to guarantee reproducibility. In addition, such materials should be **properly cited within the bibliographic reference lists** of the submission using an appropriate persistent identifier (e.g. a DOI).

Among possible kinds of material to include there are:  
* software developed and/or reused as part of an analysis; 
* a precise description of the protocol (sequence of steps, system configurations, software versions used, etc.) adopted to gather data and/or run an analysis; 
* the raw datasets used in an experiment;
* the output datasets produced as the outcome of an analysis/experiment;
* models (e.g. ontologies and ML models) used in the experiment;
* etc. 

New material produced within the work described in the submission can be archived in either general purposes repositories (e.g. Zenodo, https://zenodo.org/) or repositories devoted to specific kinds of material, such as Software Heritage for software (https://www.softwareheritage.org/), Protocols.io for protocols and workflows (https://www.protocols.io/), and FAIR Sharing for metadata standards and databases (https://fairsharing.org/). Usually, **these repositories should return persistent identifiers** that can be used to cite the material properly in the submission. 

The authors **should explicitly justify** in their submission whether scenarios **prevent their work's full reproducibility**. Examples of these scenarios may include situations where the material used cannot be archived openly due to intellectual property rights issues or other legal concerns, such as personal data.
