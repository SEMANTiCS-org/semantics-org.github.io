## NextGen Industry Solutions  - PoolParty at SEMANTiCS 2023

The SEMANTiCS conference has proudly been a longstanding tradition for Semantic Web Company (SWC) where we have had a notable presence at the conference for the last 17 years. And as every year we take the opportunity to present newest developments and ideas in connection with our flagship product of SWC, [PoolParty Semantic Suite](https://www.poolparty.biz/).  

Over the years we developed our suite towards a powerful semantic middleware encompasses a wide range of semantic capabilities that include: taxonomy, concept tagging, text mining, natural language processing, semantic search, recommender systems, and knowledge graph solutions. In other words, it is the most complete semantic middleware on the market, serving as the powerful intermediary between enterprise databases and applications so that the knowledge models of any valuable enterprise asset (customers, partners, employees, products, etc.) can continuously evolve in a stable, interconnected environment.  

This year, SWC is glad to participate again in this conference with a particular focus on how Semantic AI and digitalization can help organizations move towards sustainability and more efficient operations in three dedicated focus areas. In the coming years, PoolParty will provide solutions to help organizations **optimize their changing workplace** (in the face of recent rates of high turnover and turbulent times), **create intelligent content systems** for technical service and support, and **manage risks and compliance in the ESG space.**  

For PoolParty, SEMANTiCS is a place for presentation, discussion and feedback on our latest industry solutions. We will present the **Knowledge Hub** as a core concept for modern knowledge management, our **new approaches in search and recommendation systems** as well as solutions that realize the **possibilities of combined statistical and symbolic AI**.
This year is also the year we step up our focus on ESG, building on strong client projects already established. We are proud to present the first version of our comprehensive ESG Knowledge Graph, which forms the basis for solutions that support companies in their attempt to deliver better ESG reporting on the one hand and enable investors to identify genuine sustainable investment opportunities on the other.
