We interviewed GNOSS, a Semantic Web Enterprise, and asked them a few questions regarding their main products, their role in the Semantic Web Community, and about their vision.  

##	What is your flagship product, technology, or service and how do you envision it in the next 5 years?
GNOSS is a pioneer company in the construction of the Semantic Web in Spain with two decades of experience in the creation and development of Symbolic or Semantic Artificial intelligence; a manufacturer of its own technology, which builds and exploits Knowledge Graphs applying semantic technologies. It offers GNOSS Semantic AI Platform, a Cognitive Development Platform that can be customized and adapted to the customer's needs and data collections, as well as a set of technological services on existing platforms and that, since last year, has a community version, which offers its open source on the one hand, and an Enterprise version, on the other hand.  

The GNOSS Semantic AI Platform integrates GNOSS Knowledge Graph Builder (GKGB), which allows building projects that integrate heterogeneous and distributed data, consolidating them in a knowledge graph, to which information enrichment services can be assembled based on entity linking and enrichment using Natural Language Processing techniques, resorting, if desired, to the services of its own Artificial Intelligence services platform GNOSS Sherlock AI (sherlock.gnoss.ai). gnoss.ai) and provide access to this intelligent and desilophied ecosystem from a single point of interrogation thanks to its publishing system operating on GNOSS Semantic Application Server, the third component of the platform. Projects realized with the GNOSS Semantic AI Platform are offered and operated as a service in the cloud.  

Considering the speed at which Artificial Intelligence is advancing, its uses and now also its regulation, something that we at GNOSS find indispensable, perhaps it is too early to say what will happen in 5 years, but we can say that Knowledge Graphs are the present and the future of Artificial Intelligence and that we will continue to improve our platform and its services. We are currently building our first Open World Generative Conversational Assistants; in the nearby future, they will be another way to put information and AI at the service of people while bringing even more value to our customers' data.

##	What are your main goals and expectations for sponsoring SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023?
We at GNOSS have been working for two decades in the Semantic Artificial Intelligence program and this event is essential for us as it presents the latest advances in Linguistic Intelligence with top level participants and a great variety of sessions and topics. This European forum allows us not only to show our latest developments, but also to see the latest work being done and, of course, to establish relationships with potential customers and partners.  

Moreover, as you know, as part of the conference, the DBpedia Day is organized. GNOSS is a DBpedia association member since 2019 and works and believes in the ideas that DBpedia promotes. That is why we will also be able to present one of our latest projects in this forum.  The projects we work on always have people in mind, as well as the benefits they can get from technology to improve their lives.  

In our keynote as Silver sponsor of the event, we will be talking about our Open World Generative Conversational Assistant and we are eager to talk and hear about generative AI technologies and other hot topics with the other experts and organizations.

##	In which way SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023 attendees can benefit from your products/services?
We give life and meaning to the heterogeneous and distributed data and information of our clients, through the construction of their organizations' Knowledge Graph. We turn our clients' data into information that brings them real value. As we, at GNOSS, usually say: we put your data to work.  

For this purpose, we have developed our own platform, GNOSS Semantic AI Platform, a semantic framework for developers with Open and Enterprise versions, which is the way to better interpret the contents and resources of your organization and thereby make the promises of the new digital world a reality: personalization, anticipation, concreteness, speed, agility, and adaptation.

##	More broadly, what do you think are the necessity and benefits of computational semantics in an increasingly AI-powered business environment? And how your product, technology, or service fits into this paradigm shift?
Tim Berners-Lee defined the Semantic Web concept as an extension of the Web that provides a solution to limitations related to information format, integration, and retrieval. Semantic Technologies are now an essential facilitator, a key component of the Artificial Intelligence program and of the necessary, for its achievement, interoperability between data sources. From a general point of view, knowledge graphs are crucial in the development of Artificial Intelligence and have been identified by the major technological consulting firms of international prestige, such as Gartner or Forrester, as the fundamental element of change that will make it possible to move from distributed information silos to platforms containing digitalized ecosystems, which seems an inexcusable condition for the management of intelligent knowledge in organizations.  

For more than 5 decades, DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) has led the research and development that has made possible the advancement and application of Artificial Intelligence technologies based on rules and statistical learning (Machine Learning and Deep Learning). According to them, next-generation AI will allow systems to add the ability to explain their results and provide them with reasoning with "common sense knowledge". This in practice means that the AI of the future will be a semantically interpreted AI, and the disambiguated and indubitable recognition of entities and their linking in a meaningful knowledge graph, i.e., in a graph that contains the rules that model the functioning of these entities in the world perceived by people, is a sine qua non condition for the construction of an AI equipped with common sense.  

GNOSS builds "cognitive artifacts" or "artificial minds" so that machines can speak with us in a commonsense framework. These kinds of artifacts are in practice knowledge graphs, a kind of machine-computable mathematical structure that is at the heart of the Semantic Artificial Intelligence Program. The result of our projects is a system interrogable by both machines and people that offers at the end of its construction and future evolutions and in near real time a set of customized visualizations according to the different audiences, with special sensitivity to their diversity and integration, of what is happening in the organization that affects them. The system will also allow the improvement of decision-making processes in a scenario increasingly characterized by complexity, the permanent irruption of emerging ideas, topics, and approaches, as well as the development of different exploitations of the knowledge graph built for this purpose (meta-search engine, faceted search engines, profiling, recommendation, enrichment with internal and external sources, etc.).
