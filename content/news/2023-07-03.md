We interviewed metaphacts, a knowledge graph and decision intelligence software company, and asked them a few questions regarding their main products, their role in the Semantic Web Community, and about their vision.  

## What is your flagship product, technology, or service and how do you envision it in the next 5 years?

Our flagship product metaphactory delivers an end-to-end platform that enables customers to transform data into human- and machine-understandable knowledge that can be used to derive actionable insights and drive smarter business decisions. It helps accelerate our customers’ AI journey – from knowledge modeling to knowledge consumption via model- and data-driven user interfaces.  

metaphactory supports the collaborative creation of semantic models to explicitly capture domain expertise and knowledge that is usually hidden in long documents, spreadsheets or expert minds’ or is hard-coded into software. With metaphactory, domain experts and business users can contribute and drive the modeling process alongside technology experts. Knowledge becomes a shared asset that is captured and published through one central portal and can be consumed by all relevant people, processes or tools in the enterprise - across use cases and departmental boundaries. This significantly increases data literacy and accelerates knowledge democratization.  

The added contextual richness of data is leveraged in metaphactory’s model-driven interfaces and promotes comprehensive analysis and knowledge discovery, creation, and sharing that was previously unachievable. It provides the real, curated knowledge behind symbolic AI solutions that can be used to complement data-driven AI solutions by building a comprehensive layer of trust to Machine Learning and Large Language Models.  

Our goal is to continue helping customers leverage this explicitly captured domain expertise and domain knowledge in the products and services they build to drive business success. We aim to enable them to base business decisions on AI-generated insights - combining the best of generative AI and symbolic AI - so that the insights can be trusted, traced and explained as they are grounded in the domain expertise their employees bring to the table.


## What are your main goals and expectations for sponsoring SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023?

We’ve attended the SEMANTiCS conference in the past and what we really like about it is that it stays true to the technology and the Semantic Web community without being overloaded with marketing buzzwords, while also putting a strong focus on the industry and real-world customer use cases.  

Our hope for this year’s conference is to be able to connect with both veterans in the community and adopters from the corporate sector as much as possible and learn about their vision for the technology, their experiences and their success stories, and also the challenges they’ve faced while going through the implementation phase.  

Additionally, we’re also eager to share our experience and the best practices we’ve developed to support customers adopt knowledge graphs in productive environments. Throughout our almost ten years of experience helping organizations accelerate their knowledge graph journeys, we’ve developed a number of solutions and blueprints that have proven to deliver a significant ROI for customers. We’re eager to share these with the community.

## In which way SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023 attendees can benefit from your products/services?

Attendees can start using metaphactory no matter where they are in their knowledge graph journey:  

* Whether they already have a knowledge graph but would like to build a semantic domain model that adds context to their data and drives more precise search results or powers insightful dashboards for end users;
* Whether they’ve started working with the technology but have not gotten any traction in their organization because they are lacking a tool to abstract the complexity of the knowledge graph and deliver insights to users in their domain or use case context; or
* Whether they are just starting to experiment with the technology and are looking for a tool to quickly build an MVP for their project.

## More broadly, what do you think are the necessity and benefits of computational semantics in an increasingly AI-powered business environment? And how your product, technology, or service fits into this paradigm shift?

Semantic models, or ontologies, are key to building powerful knowledge graphs that help organizations drive explainable and trustworthy business decisions. They enrich existing data with context and meaning that humans and machines can interpret. Without a semantic model, a knowledge graph is simply a graph structure that visualizes interlinked data. This explicit, domain expert-curated knowledge and semantic context is the key to providing a layer of trust for AI-driven products and services.  

With increasing reliance on LLMs and AI-driven apps in all aspects of our work and life, the adoption of semantic models to augment these solutions is becoming more critical than ever. They can not only improve the quality of the recommendations, decisions or inferences made by AI but also ensure that end users can understand and follow the reasoning behind those decisions.
