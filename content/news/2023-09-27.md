It has been a great event: three amazing conference days with 359 attendees, of which 283 were onsite. The scientific community received a lot of interesting input on Machine Learning, Data Science, Linked Data and Natural Language Processing. The programme included exciting and timely keynotes, workshops, tutorials and plenty of opportunities for networking. We kicked off the conference with the DBpedia Day on the 20th of September. This was followed by two fully-packed conference days, which ended with the award ceremony.  

It was an honor to host the SEMANTiCS & Language Intelligence community in Leipzig, Germany. We hope you had a great time, new inspiring ideas, and the chance to promote your research.
