## What is your flagship technology or service and how do you envision it in the next 5 years?

PANTOPIX stands for intelligent solutions in technical communication. With our many years of expertise, we support companies in optimizing their information processes and ensure the maximum added value of their digital data. Together with our customers, we are shaping their digital future with innovative projects and technologies. More and more companies see the need to break down their information silos, optimize internal processes and intelligently provide their company-wide data to be more efficient and even open new business models. Today, we connect structured and unstructured content with knowledge graphs. Tomorrow, we even find smart solution to connect semantics and generative AI technologies to bring more value to our customer’s data.  

## What are your main goals and expectations for sponsoring SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023?

As a long-time project partner of the Semantics Web Company and an expert in the field of semantics, ontologies, knowledge graph technologies and information management, we are pleased to support the event as GOLD Sponsor again. We are already looking forward to the unique program around semantics, to the informative and insightful talks and workshops and, of course, to the exchange with customers, partners and experts from all over the world.
We are keen to talk about generative AI technologies and other trending topics.

## In which way SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023 attendees can benefit from your services?

We offer to turn our customer’s information into value. With our many years of experience, we accompany our customers in the analysis of existing processes, in the development of new concepts and in the introduction and integration of new systems, methods and tools in order to provide their information intelligently. Our Knowledge Engineers strive to keep up with the latest technologies and we are committed to showing our customers where their journey can take them.


## More broadly, what do you think are the necessity and benefits of computational semantics in an increasingly AI-powered business environment? And how your service fits into this paradigm shift?

We are confident that semantics are playing a key part in an AI-powered business environment by enabling machines to understand and process human language more effectively. The combination of semantics and large language models will turn information into real value. Semantics can enhance information retrieval systems by analyzing the semantics of text, enable machines to understand and interpret human language in a meaningful way and thus ensures a more natural and intuitive user experience. Semantics empowers the representation of knowledge in a structured and machine-readable format. It allows AI systems to draw logical conclusions, make informed decisions, and provide intelligent recommendations. It enhances the capabilities of AI-powered business applications, such as expert systems, recommendation engines, and automated decision-making systems. As we provide theses services and technologies, we are able to make our customers' information landscape fit for the future.
