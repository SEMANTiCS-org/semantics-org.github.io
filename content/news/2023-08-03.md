We invite all SEMANTiCS and DBpedia Day attendees to join us on our journey to further strengthen the Semantic Web community.  

We offer a special session in the late afternoon of the 20th September, where we will have an intense discussion on three major topics that keep us awake and where we can only make progress when we join our expertise and passion.  

In break-out dialogs industry people may contribute their pressing problem and ask for solution ideas from academics. On the other hand academics may sketch their innovative idea and/or approach and question the industrial relevance and usability.  

This networking event follows a mini bar camp approach with a series of moderated discussions in three parallel break-out groups. Everybody joining is invited to bring his or her problem/approach to the table so that the break-out group may work on it.  

If you want to prepare, please, follow these question lines:

* “What practical challenge are you, business applicant, currently facing and want to discuss with researchers?”  
* "What idea/solution do you, researcher, currently have in mind that you would like to check for its practical value with business applicants?”  

As a wrap-up the results will be summarized for the overall audience.  

Based on the accepted papers and presentations we identified the following urgent topics that we want to address:  

* **Quo Vadis Knowledge Graphs?**
* **LLM – Ready to Rumble?!**
* **Semantics Wanted – Dead or Alive**

After the event we invite you all to a Get Together where more informal talks will take place and where your old friendships will be revived, and new friends will be made.  

We look forward to welcome you at the SEMANTiCS conference hotel Hyperion on the 20th September at 4:30 p.m.
