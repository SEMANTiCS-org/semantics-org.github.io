We interviewed Ontotext, a leading company developing software based on the Semantic Web languages and standards, and asked them a few questions regarding their main products, their role in the Semantic Web Community, and about their vision.

## What is your flagship product, technology, or service and how do you envision it in the next 5 years?

In 5 years, the goal is for Ontotext to have enhanced their technology to enable enterprises of all sizes and technical abilities to build and implement B2B knowledge graphs.  

To predict the future, we need to understand the present. Currently, big enterprises are drowning in data, which to use, they would need to fund yet another data integration project. Knowledge graphs are the only solution for modern enterprises to make their data most accessible, and reusable. With knowledge graphs, their data enterprise becomes intelligent through reasoning, and they can most effectively utilize emerging technologies like AI/ML/LLM. Each big technology vendor (Google, Microsoft, Uber, Airbnb, etc.) has successfully implemented their own knowledge graph to solve primary needs in their B2C business. Now, the challenge becomes extending this, to enable enterprises of all sizes and technical abilities to build B2B knowledge graphs.

## What are your main goals and expectations for sponsoring SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023?

Ontotext’s main goals and expectations are to generate brand awareness and interest in our knowledge graph offering, collect quality sales leads while delivering thought leadership in this area.

## In which way SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023 attendees can benefit from your products/services?

Knowledge graphs, such as what Ontotext delivers, are used in natural language processing, semantic search, and AI applications such as ChatGPT, Generative AI and others. KGs give AI an important dimension of context, and help to integrate, learn and reason from disparate data, making machine learning meaningful and impactful.  

Semantic knowledge graphs connect different, disparate information and represent relationships in a way that is valuable and meaningful. Ontotext helps global enterprises gain knowledge and insights from diverse data sources, enabling them to make informed decisions and stay ahead of the competition and build a strong data strategy.  

The greatest value we offer lies at the intersection of knowledge graphs and semantic metadata. Our GraphDB solution, the RDF engine for knowledge graphs that has been used worldwide for 15+ years, can give researchers, industry experts and business leaders the advantage of being able to build knowledge graphs quickly and easily. Recently, Ontotext GraphDB passed both Linked Data Benchmarking Council’s (LDBC) Social Network Benchmark (SNB) and Semantic Publishing Benchmarks (SPB), proving its unique capability to handle graph analytics and metadata management workloads simultaneously. With GraphDB and our solutions across industries including Healthcare & Life Sciences, Financial Services. Media & Publishing, Retail, SEMANTICS and Language Intelligence attendees can interconnect, integrate and harmonize siloed data to add context to the knowledge-intensive challenges they are facing and find a robust, long-term approach to knowledge discovery, analysis and decision making.  

## More broadly, what do you think are the necessity and benefits of computational semantics in an increasingly AI-powered business environment? And how your product, technology, or service fits into this paradigm shift?

The necessity of computational semantics in an increasingly AI-powered business environment is clear: cleaner, reusable, more connected data with strict provenance. In other words, quality data is paramount to any AI-system.  

The adage “garbage in, garbage out” is more relevant than ever. Central to today’s efficient business operations are the activities of data capturing and storage, search, sharing, and data analytics. Get these wrong and chances are your enterprise processes and systems will suffer, leading to revenue, productivity and customer losses.  

GraphDB allows organizations to properly train their AI-powered systems in order to include the necessary context and reasoning. GraphDB turns the adage around, ingesting quality data and providing quality results in return.  

GraphDB supports the paradigm shift by providing data storage in graph structures - networks where entities, concepts and literals, the nodes, describe each other via typed relationships, the edges. Key for the so-called knowledge graphs is the use of semantic schema, ontologies, to allow for unambiguous interpretation of the meaning of the data. This allows for validation of the ingested data - the “quality data in'' promise. These semantic models also allow for inference of facts that are not explicitly stated in the input data, this way adding quality data. To sum it up, GraphDB provides downstream applications, including AI models, semantically consistent unified and enriched data.  

Case in point, our demonstrator built on top of a knowledge graph we have been developing internally. Below you can read a result from where our system, hooked to ChatGPT, is answering your first question based on our own content:  

*“SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023 attendees can benefit from GraphDB in the following ways: 1. Advanced Analytics: GraphDB enables advanced analytics on large-scale knowledge graphs, allowing attendees to gain insights and make data-driven decisions based on entity awareness and data linking. 2. Data Integration and Unification: GraphDB's semantic approach helps in organizing and integrating disparate data sources into enterprise knowledge graphs. This enables attendees to connect and publish complex knowledge, link documents to graphs, extract new facts, classify and recommend content. 3. Querying and Inference: GraphDB supports semantic data modeling and allows attendees to query the data and make further inferences. This capability helps in understanding the data better and extracting deeper insights. 4. Knowledge Governance and Quality: Attendees can benefit from GraphDB's capability to preserve information metadata, source, and provenance. It enables better knowledge governance and quality using graph and semantic technology stack. 5. Partner Ecosystem: Ontotext, the provider of GraphDB, has a network of partners that provides a dynamic combination of technology stack and professional services. This ensures attendees can access the best technology blend to meet their specific business needs. In summary, GraphDB offers attendees at SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023 the opportunity to leverage the power of knowledge graphs, advanced analytics, and semantic data management to solve complex business problems and unlock new opportunities.”*
