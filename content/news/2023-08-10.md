# Tracking Open Science Best Practices at Semantics 2023
##### August 10, 2023 by Daniel Garijo, Knowledge Graph Chair

This year at Semantics we decided to embrace Open Science best practices and also eat our own dog food. Hence, we created a small Knowledge Graph (KG) linking all accepted papers with their associated resources (data, code, ontologies and demos). We used this KG to generate the "accepted papers" pages in the main webiste. Each entry now look as shown in the figure below:

Each paper is described displaying the license, description and DOI of each of their resources (when available). Once the conference is over, we will update these pages with the corresponding paper image (an illustrator will create them based on available talks) and its URL or DOI.

## Creating the KG

The figure below shows the main process followed to create the KG. Data sources come from Easychair, selecting only those papers that have been accepted. Next, resources from papers have been extracted through a semi-automated pipeline, based on the responses submitted by authors and manually curating them (we checked all links to avoid spam and described each resource with metadata when available). Finally, we used RML mappings and the [Morph-KGC engine](https://github.com/oeg-upm/morph-kgc) to create the final [RDF file](https://github.com/dgarijo/semantics-org.github.io/blob/master/kg/rdf/out.nt). This is the file that is later used to derive statistics and generate the HTML pages for the conference.

We follow a simple data model, reusing the [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) vocabulary as much as possible. All papers are schema:ScholarlyArticles, that are part of tracks (schema:Event) and are authored by schema:Persons. Each article has either datasets (schema:Dataset), code repositories (schema:SoftwareSourceCode), ontologies (owl:Ontology) or Demos (schema:SoftwareApplication). The rest of the properties and data properties are detailed in the figure below:

As a result, our KG has 2521 triples, which describe 50 papers, 22 code repositories, 11 datasets, 7 demos and 5 ontologies.

## Statistics about Open Science best practices
Thanks to the KG, now we can easily generate conference statistics showing the amount of resources shared. These are the following:

- Number of accepted papers:  50 (industry + posters + research). Non-accepted papers have not been described in the KG.
- Number of papers with resources: 26
- Papers with datasets, with code or ontologies:
    - Code repository: 22
    - Dataset: 11
    - Demo: 7
    - Ontology: 5
- Resources with license: 27 (note that some papers have more than 1 resource)
- Papers with resources that have a license: 22
- Papers with no license in one of their resources: 13
- Papers with resources providing DOIs: 5
- Total number of resources with DOIs: 8
- Papers storing data in GitHub: 7

We see that more than half of the papers reuse or generate a resource, with code being more widely shared than data (although this depends on the type of submission). Interestingly, there is no yet widespread practice of using persistent identifiers for sharing data or code, which helps reproducibility (as it points to the specific version used in a paper) and provides authors with proper credit (usually platforms that allow arhiving data and code, like Zenodo, also provide the corresponding citation). In addition, 7 GitHub repositories are used for sharing data along with their code instead of using a data archival repository.

By making visible datasets, code, ontologies and demos from the conference page, we hope to inspire more researchers to share their resources and make it easier to reproduce existing work.

All code, data (RDF files), SPARQL queries and scripts used are available in the Semantics conference GitHub repository: https://github.com/SEMANTiCS-org/semantics-org.github.io. Data (sources, RDF files) are also available in [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8225446).
