SEMANTiCS conference has always been unique in the way industry use case presentations and academic research papers are discussed at the same conference. This has created a unique vibe in which hot innovations and concrete real-life use cases are brought together.

Looking back at the past years, we notice that industry use cases have increased in business impact and size. Similarly, the time between academic research and practical use has decreased: an academic submission in one year might result in an industry use case submission the next year. Last year, we observed several academic submissions that were relevant to the industry track as well, as they already included real-life practical applications.

We might argue: Semantics has become a trend by itself.

We notice semantic technology in a lot of fields that might not have incorporated semantic technology in the past. We could summarise this with “Meaning over structure”. This is particularly noticeable in the fields of Language Technology, Artificial Intelligence and Data Management.

A lot of things are happening around language technology. We have seen the rise of conversational chatbots, notably ChatGPT and the use of large language models (essentially knowledge graphs!) in combination with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Language Technology is incorporating semantics: not only the structure of a language but also its meaning (words being part of a knowledge graph).

Trends in Artificial Intelligence are pushing language technology forward. Explainable AI, trustful AI and responsible AI all need language technology to be able to use, to understand full-text documents and to communicate back in natural language: explaining the results.

Looking at the day-to-day operations of data-intensive organisations, the role of semantics in Data Management has become a hot issue. Challenges with regard to data quality, interoperability and reuse of data and compliance have increased the need to invest in semantic solutions. Reuse and interoperability is enabled by a knowledge graph that not only contains the available data but is also linked to an explicitly modelled notion of its meaning and quality. This development enables organisations to move towards global knowledge graphs: available and reusable beyond their original scope and purpose.

At the same time, we have a lot of ground still to discover. With the proliferation of AI and ML technology, the need for transparency, responsible solutions and ethics is urgent. Last year’s keynote was titled “Taming Turing’s legacy”. How appropriate! In recent years, machines have come to play an increased number of games: from chess, Jeopardy! to GO. And even now, news stories tell us about a machine that can successfully play the imitation game. We have run out of games – it is time for serious business!

We challenge both the industry and the academic community for SEMANTiCS 2023: we look forward to your submissions! From the industry community, we expect use cases that are at the core of their business, solving challenges that keep their business running. From the academic community, we would like to see research in the field of responsible AI and how semantics can help to make AI trustful, compliant and explainable.
