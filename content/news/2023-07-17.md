We interviewed Neo4j, a company operating a graph database platform, and asked them a few questions regarding their main products, their role in the Semantic Web Community, and about their vision.

## What is your flagship product, technology, or service and how do you envision it in the next 5 years?

Neo4j is the world's leading graph database and analytics platform, revolutionizing the way organizations unlock insights from complex, interconnected data. Over the next five years, we envision further strengthening our position in the graph space as awareness and adoption of graph technology continue to grow across industries. Our flagship product will continue to evolve, delivering even more powerful graph analytics capabilities, enhanced performance, and seamless integration with cutting-edge technologies. We are committed to providing a comprehensive ecosystem for developers and data scientists, empowering them to harness the full potential of graph databases in solving critical business challenges. As we forge ahead, we anticipate expanding our reach to new domains, fueling innovation, and driving transformative outcomes for organizations worldwide.

## What are your main goals and expectations for sponsoring SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023?

Our main goals and expectations for sponsoring SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023 are driven by the increasing interest we have observed among semantic stack practitioners in our graph data platform. We have noticed a growing number of customers incorporating principles and technologies from the semantic stack into their neo4j implementations. Building on this trend, our objective is to establish a stronger presence within the semantic tech community and enhance our visibility in that domain. We believe that SEMANTICS2023 provides an excellent forum for achieving these goals, allowing us to engage with like-minded professionals, share our expertise, and foster collaborations that push the boundaries of graph and semantic technologies. By participating in this event, we aim to contribute to the advancement of the field and forge valuable connections that drive mutual growth and innovation.

## In which way SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023 attendees can benefit from your products/services?

SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023 attendees can greatly benefit from our products and services in several ways. Firstly, our presence at the event will provide attendees with an opportunity to become familiar with our platform for the construction of modern semantic applications. They will gain insights into the powerful capabilities of our graph data platform, which can be seamlessly integrated with principles and technologies from the semantic stack. Moreover, attendees will have the chance to learn about the success stories and real-world implementations of our customers, showcasing the tangible benefits and transformative impact of our solutions. By engaging with us, attendees can expand their knowledge, gather practical insights, and explore new possibilities for leveraging graph and semantic technologies in their own projects and organizations.

## More broadly, what do you think are the necessity and benefits of computational semantics in an increasingly AI-powered business environment? And how your product, technology, or service fits into this paradigm shift?

In an increasingly AI-powered business environment, computational semantics plays a vital role in ensuring the necessity and reaping the benefits of AI. At Neo4j, we strongly believe that knowledge graphs are essential in this paradigm shift. Knowledge graphs provide a queriable and contextually explainable ground truth, unlike plausible generated answers from Generative AI models. This becomes particularly crucial in domains where explainability and trustworthiness are paramount, such as healthcare, finance, or legal sectors. As AI continues to evolve, our product team is actively exploring synergies between Language Models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs. By integrating these technologies, we aim to enhance our platform's capabilities, offering users the ability to leverage the power of LLMs while benefiting from the explainability and trustworthiness provided by knowledge graphs. This integration will empower businesses to make informed decisions, gain deeper insights, and foster greater transparency in AI-powered applications, ultimately driving innovation and building trust in the AI ecosystem.
