We are thrilled to announce that the 19th edition of SEMANTiCS, the leading European conference on semantic technologies, will be held from 20 to 22 September in Leipzig, Germany. Dr. Sahar Vahdati, Research Group Leader at the Institute of Applied Informatics (InfAI), will be taking over the position of the conference chair.  

The SEMANTiCS conference is an established knowledge hub which brings together technology professionals, industry experts, and researchers to exchange knowledge regarding new technologies, innovations, and enterprise implementations in the fields of Linked Data and Semantic AI. Over the past years SEMANTiCS took place in different cities like Vienna, Amsterdam and Karlsruhe. Now, it's returning to Saxony after ten years and we are celebrating this anniversary.  

[Leipzig](http://english.leipzig.de/), as one of the fast growing cities in Germany, has recently gained international recognition, and risen  to be a cultural hot spot. With its incredible boom during the past 15 years, more and more people moved to Hypezig not only because of its mix of long traditions and rich culture, but also because of its vibrant creative art, music scene and charismatic flair. The list of features that help Leipzig to live up to this reputation is sheer endless.  

The success of its previous edition in Vienna, with more than 330 attendees from 22 countries, proves that SEMANTiCS is an established transfer-oriented summit for Semantic Web enthusiasts. SEMANTiCS 2023 will continue the tradition of bringing together information managers, IT-architects, software engineers and researchers from organizations ranging from NGOs, through public administrations to some of the world's largest companies who discuss recent developments in various fields of the semantic web universe.
