We interviewed Semantic Partners, a network of experienced Data Engineers, who love the power of Semantic Tech to break the boundaries of data-silos, and asked them a few questions regarding their main products, their role in the Semantic Web Community, and about their vision.

## What is your flagship product, technology, or service and how do you envision it in the next 5 years?

Our flagship service focus is the selection, implementation and ongoing work focused on the delivery of RDF based Knowledge Graphs. We have several decades of deep semantic expertise as a team ranging from ontology modelling, data architecture, hands on implementation and customisation of many vendor products. We also offer structured 1 day training courses on Knowledge Graphs and Semantic engineering for those who are new to the topic.  

We have seen a significant increase in interest in the above technologies over the past 2 years, and see the next 5 years as pivotal in the wide scale adoption of semantic technologies, which has been a long time coming!

## What are your main goals and expectations for sponsoring SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023?

We are keen to tell people we are here. We have thus far grown organically mainly through referrals and partners. As a boutique RDF consultancy, we are here to help any organisations thinking about moving to a data-centric model.  

We offer a vendor neutral approach to services consulting and our Principal Consultants are likely to have encountered many of the issues organisations face, when considering adoption of Knowledge Graph, Ontologies or Semantic engineering principles. We feel that the SEMANTiCS 2023 audience will offer us a wider view of organisational business goals related to the adoption of the semantic web technologies and Knowledge Graphs.  

## In which way SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023 attendees can benefit from your products/services?

Attendees can benefit from hearing about one of our 15 and growing customer use cases we have worked on - We cover verticals from Pharmaceutical, Banking, Automotive and Engineering in addition to tech startups. Hear about use cases such as -  

* Data Mesh - Global Investment Bank
* Reduction in data gathering from months to seconds - Global Pharma
* AI Drug Discovery for new markets - Bio Tech
* Corporate Knowledge Base - Automotive

## More broadly, what do you think are the necessity and benefits of computational semantics in an increasingly AI-powered business environment? And how your product, technology, or service fits into this paradigm shift?

The precursor to AI and its wider adoption is Data. Data needs to be clean, it needs to be organised and it needs to be machine readable. The best way to do this is to organise data in a Knowledge Graph. If firms are to truly embrace AI and understand what the power of an LLM could do for them, using their own data, we believe the best place to start on this journey is to organise your data using Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs. We help organisations do this; our team of Semantic experts are the premier group of technologists in Europe that are focusing on this.
