We interviewed Peter Crocker, the CEO of Oxford Semantic Technologies, and asked him a few questions about RDFox, its role in the Semantic Web Community, and about its future.

##	What is RDFox and how do you envision it in the next 5 years?
RDFox is the world’s most performant [knowledge graph](https://www.oxfordsemantic.tech/fundamentals/what-is-a-knowledge-graph) and [semantic reasoning engine](https://www.oxfordsemantic.tech/fundamentals/what-is-semantic-reasoning), and is being used by organisations all across the world to meet their data needs. From the simplest tasks to the most complex problems, these companies rely on the speed and advanced rules-based AI capabilities of RDFox to create the next wave of [semantic solutions](https://www.oxfordsemantic.tech/solutions).  

The reason they choose RDFox is simple: it allows them to create solutions that others can’t.
The in-memory design and patented technologies mean load and query performance of RDFox can’t be matched, while also being so lightweight that it can be deployed on anything from tiny edge-device to the largest cloud instance. By incorporating RDFox’s cutting-edge incremental reasoning, our clients have built semantic applications that were simply not possible before, leveraging real-time analysis and updates to add functionality and transform query efficiency. Current implementations of RDFox have enabled autonomous vehicles, massive industrial configuration management, and financial trade surveillance and compliance—to name just a few.  

Having initially been spun-out from decades of research at the University of Oxford, [Oxford Semantic Technologies](https://www.oxfordsemantic.tech/) have spent the past years developing RDFox into the enterprise ready software that it is today. Functionality such as high-availability, scalable deployment, and access control have been some of the highlights, alongside technical features such as named graph support, remote access, and of course improved performance. The next 5 years look to be no different as we continue add features that meet our clients’ needs. This includes further functionality to support the use of LLMs and Generative AI. There are huge benefits to be gained from combining the technologies as some of our clients have already shown by bringing truth and correctness to powerful yet otherwise hallucinogenic space. And, as always, we'll continue to improve the RDFox engine to ensure that our clients have the world's fastest graph database at their disposal.

##	What are your main goals and expectations for sponsoring SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023?
At SEMANTiCS this year we're excited to share the benefits of high-performance rules-based AI and what our clients have achieved with it. Across industry and sector, they have created cutting-edge solutions that were only been made possible by the unmatched speed and capability of RDFox's semantic reasoning—rules-based AI. Some of our clients and partners will even be joining us at SEMANTiCS this year, eager to show off their innovations so that others can follow in their footsteps.  

The future of the industry is also hot on our minds, and we're thrilled to discuss our thoughts in these exciting times. As companies reach for more and more innovative solutions, the need for advanced technology rises exponentially, and so too does the need for speed and functionality. RDFox stands as the key to unlock the most powerful applications. This is particularly clear with the explosion in popularity of LLMs which have opened the door to new possibilities but still require refinement when it comes to auditability and accuracy. Both explainability and absolute truth come from semantic reasoning, and by combining the two we gain access to immense benefits that draw on the strengths of each technology.  

We're headed to SEMANTiCS in person, so, more than anything else, we're looking forward to talking with the community about their latest projects and dreams. There are countless opportunities where reasoning can support or enable users to realize their goals, and our aim is to help as many people as we can to do just that. If you'd like to discuss your project and what reasoning can do for you, come and find us there!

##	How will SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023 attendees benefit from RDFox?
To those at SEMANTiCS looking for inspiration for an application they're building or planning to build, we'll be showcasing the solutions that have been created by our clients and the problems they solve to demonstrate the extent of what's possible. For those wanting to dive deeper into how our clients have achieved this, we'll also be discussing the technical backing of RDFox beyond its unmatched speed and advanced reasoning  

Performance is at the heart of many practical applications and, alongside the patented highly optimized technology that was born out of research at the University of Oxford, reasoning plays a vital role. However, as a cutting-edge technology, its true benefits are not widely and fully understood, so with the help of our clients, we'll be demonstrating exactly how it can transform use cases, turning what was previously impossible into reality.  

The gains of reasoning are two-fold: RDFox's reasoning occurs on startup as opposed to at query time, drastically reducing the time to get an answer to a question from hours to milliseconds; and the incremental nature of RDFox means any updates to the data or rules will happen in real-time, without the need for a restart, instantly applying the consequences of any changes that are made. When combined with functionality such as negation and aggregation, enterprise features such as high availability, and deployment options ranging from on-device to on-cloud, RDFox enables businesses to answer the questions that matter most.
We'll be showing off several use cases while at SEMANTiCS, so come to our booth if you'd like to see them for yourselves. If you can't wait that long, send us a message or even [try it out for free](https://www.oxfordsemantic.tech/tryrdfoxforfree) on our website!

##	More broadly, what do you think are the necessity and benefits of computational semantics in an increasingly AI-powered business environment? And how does RDFox fit into this paradigm shift?
The benefits of semantic reasoning in a world racing towards AI reliance are not just immensely powerful, but absolutely necessary. The advances in machine learning over the past few years have been astounding, giving us a glimpse of what this tech has to offer, but, it has also revealed its flaws.  

For example, generative AI offers a vast range of extraordinary applications, generating human-like outputs with emulated understanding and creativity. However, its reliance on statistical patterns hinders accuracy and may yield unreliable outcomes and hallucinations. The missing piece is knowledge reasoning and representation (KRR)—rules-based AI—which provides a structured framework for capturing domain-specific knowledge and enabling precise decision-making with unambiguous truth.
By combining the two approaches, we can leverage the strengths of each and, in doing so, avoid their shortfalls. Their fusion creates a solution that enables generative AI to give accurate, context-grounded results based on factual knowledge and rules-based logic.  

It’s not hard to produce a list of use cases that rely on auditable information or accurate results. Whether it’s in healthcare, law, or autonomy, it's clear that some decisions need to be made with a logical backing as people’s lives are quite literally at risk. As with any tech revolution the stakes have been raised and its vital we stay ahead of the potential ramifications.
This is the role of semantic tech, and it's what some RDFox users are already doing today.
