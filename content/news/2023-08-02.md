We interviewed Karakun, a company developing solutions whenever there is no suitable standard software on the market, and asked them a few questions regarding their main products, their role in the Semantic Web Community, and about their vision.

## What is Karakun's HIBU platform and how do you envision it in the next 5 years?

In a nutshell, Karakun is a software engineering company that helps its customers transform their processes into the digital world. For this purpose, Karakun offers standard software applications, software platforms, and customized software solutions to meet even the most individual requirements. In particular, we develop “content-driven AI solutions” together with our customers – based on our own [HIBU platform](https://hibu-platform.com/) and our comprehensive expertise in AI, NLP and information retrieval. These solutions enable businesses to automatically classify, extract and analyze their data with high accuracy and speed, thereby improving search capabilities, automating workflows or extracting insights from unstructured data. For a range of use cases and industries, we generalized these custom solutions into ready-to-use software products, most recently in the domain of [data protection](https://pidcockpit.com/).  

The HIBU platform is constantly growing, providing additional functionalities and content services that our customer solutions can apply. Partly by collaborating with universities, we continuously seek to transform cutting-edge insights of the research community into scalable and production-ready software components. The current focus is, of course, on exploring additional ways to exploit LLMs and generative AI in the use cases of our customers.  

In five years, we want some of these new LLM and generative AI functionalities to be used in production at an industrial scale, and to be able to serve more language technology use cases out of the box.

## What are your main goals and expectations for sponsoring SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023?  

Community engagement is an important part of Karakun's DNA. We love to share know-how and market experience with other experts and discuss with them current findings, challenges, market needs and industry standards – particularly in these exciting times in the field of AI and language technology where new insights, innovations and opinions pop up virtually every day. We have been in this field for more than 25 years and it has never been more buzzing. This is why we do not only attend conferences as participants but also actively sponsor events to support the organizers and the entire community.  

At this year's SEMANTiCS, we are showcasing the ["Library of Guidance for Health Scientists (LIGHTS)"](https://lights.science/), one of the Smart Search solutions we developed together with the University of Basel (Switzerland). With this presentation, we hope to increase the visibility of Karakun and our HIBU platform in general. We are excited to have the chance to present this solution on September 21 in our joint talk with our partner Dr Stefan Schandelmaier, Researcher at the university's Division of Clinical Epidemiology.
Most of all, we are looking forward to an inspiring exchange with other attendees, potential partners and customers.

## How will SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023 attendees benefit from the HIBU platform and your content-driven AI solutions?

What our customers value most is to have a single partner that offers both, AI & NLP expertise and the ability to build secure, scalable, sustainable and fully integrated solutions. Moreover, they appreciate that we are a true partner, understanding their business needs and taking them seriously: We do love technological innovations but our primary goal and motivation is to deliver value for specific use cases and business needs, and sometimes the less exciting technology might be the better choice and generate more value.  

SEMANTiCS and Language Intelligence 2023 attendees benefit if they are looking for such a partner. Our flexible platform approach allows them to get a tailor-made custom AI solution at much lower costs.

## More broadly, what do you think are the necessity and benefits of computational semantics in an increasingly AI-powered business environment? And how do the HIBU platform and your content-driven AI solutions fit into this paradigm shift?

We see the main benefits of computational semantics in business workflows (and likewise other everyday activities) in which humans and AI-powered functionalities efficiently collaborate – rather than one replacing the other. Automated AI processes can take over a lot of repetitive, monotonous and error-prone work, providing input to the more complex tasks and decisions to be made by human experts. This frees humans to use their working time on the tasks that they are best at and that require human knowledge, reasoning or judgment.  

The goal of our AI and NLP services is precisely that: to help our customers transform their existing language-based business workflows into efficient AI-supported workflows – at a pace and investment level that suits the respective customer.
