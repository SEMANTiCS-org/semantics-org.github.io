## Discover the Heart of the City  
Starting from Augustusplatz, the central square of Leipzig, you are standing in front of several landmarks, like the [Gewandhaus Concert Hall](https://www.gewandhausorchester.de/en/), the University of Leipzig, the clock tower of the [Egyptian Museum](https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/university/structure/museums-and-collections/egyptian-museum) and the [Leipzig Opera](https://www.oper-leipzig.de/en). Hard to miss is the [City-Hochhaus](https://panorama-leipzig.de/), the skyscraper that offers a panoramic view of Leipzig to its visitors.  

Walking through Leipzig's center, you will find a mixture of modern and historical buildings and will realize that it is still keeping much of its original architecture. Explore the pedestrian passageways that are filled with unique shops and restaurants, like the [Mädler Passage](https://www.maedlerpassage.de/) and [Specks Hof Passage](https://speckshof.de/de/). Find your way to the main square “Marktplatz“, where the Old Town Hall is located. It dates back to the 16th century and nowadays it hosts the [Leipzig Museum of City History](https://www.stadtgeschichtliches-museum-leipzig.de/en/). On its back, stands the Old Stock Exchange building from the 17th century.  

You might not wanna miss out on the two churches that count as historical landmarks of the city: the [St. Nicholas Church](https://www.nikolaikirche.de/) with its beautifully rose- and mint-painted interior, which is the oldest and largest church in Leipzig and counts as the central starting point of the Peaceful Revolution in 1989, and the [St. Thomas Church](https://www.thomaskirche.org/), where J. S. Bach used to work. While you are at the Thomaskirchhof, take the time to look at the details on the exterior of the Commerzbank building but also at the curved steel elements in the ground, known as the [Leipziger Notenspur](https://notenspur-leipzig.de/en/music-routes/leipzig-music-trail/route-and-stations), which can lead you to the most important original music sites over a length of 5.1 km. You can continue your walk to the New City Hall and the Federal Administrative Court and admire their imposing facades.

## Immerse in Art and History  
There are plenty of museums to visit, so you just have to make your choice. The [GRASSI](https://www.grassimuseum.de/en/) for example is a large museum quarter in the heart of Leipzig that houses three museums of international importance: the Museum of Applied Arts, the Museum of Ethnology in Leipzig and the Musical Instrument Museum. At the [Zeitgeschichtliches Forum Leipzig](https://www.hdg.de/en/zeitgeschichtliches-forum-leipzig) you can embark on a trip through German post-War history. If you are interested in art, you can head to the [Fine Arts Museum](https://mdbk.de/en/), which is also located in the city center, or to the [Kunstkraftwerk Leipzig](https://www.kunstkraftwerk-leipzig.com/de/), a museum entirely dedicated to multimedia and digital art experiences. If you are a fan of music history, you can visit the [Bach Museum](https://www.bachmuseumleipzig.de/en/bach-museum), the [Mendelssohn-Haus](https://www.mendelssohn-stiftung.de/en/) or the [Schumann-Haus](https://www.schumannhaus.de/en/).

If you still have time and want to explore more, you can take a walk at the Clara Zetkin park or the Rosental park and enjoy the largest green areas of Leipzig, visit the famous [Zoo Leipzig](https://www.zoo-leipzig.de/en/) or other neighborhoods such as the district of Plagwitz and the [Baumwollspinnerei](https://www.spinnerei.de/) that have a strong cultural presence in the city. Also worth visiting is the [Monument to the Battle of the Nations](https://www.stadtgeschichtliches-museum-leipzig.de/en/visit/our-museums/monument-of-the-battle-of-the-nations/), which was built in 1913 and commemorates the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte during the 1813 Battle of Leipzig. If the weather allows it, make sure to find some time to discover the lakes of Leipzig, such as Lake Cospuden, Kulkwitz or Markleeberg.

## Indulge in Leipzig's Culinary Delights

Alternatively, if you are in the mood for something different, explore Karl-Liebknecht street, Karl-Heine street and the Barfußgässchen. These vibrant areas present a diverse selection of restaurants, bars and cafes, ensuring you'll find the perfect spot to satisfy your cravings.
