We are pleased to announce the workshop series for SEMANTiCS 2023!  Among the workshops that have been accepted, there are two reruns of successfully organized workshops from the previous years of the SEMANTiCS conference. We also have a shiny new edition on a very hot topic. Let’s take a closer look.  

The 3rd edition of the Workshop on [Ontologies for FAIR and FAIR Ontologies (Onto4FAIR)](https://onto4fair.github.io/2023-fois.html) will see a rerun in this year's SEMANTiCS. Tracing its history – [The 2nd edition](https://onto4fair.github.io/2023-fois.html) of Onto4FAIR was organized at the [13th International Conference on Formal Ontology in Information Systems](https://fois2023.griis.ca/) (FOIS 2023). And the 1st edition was introduced at last year's SEMANTiCS 2022 held in Vienna, Austria. The FAIR principles, which stand for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, are a set of guiding principles designed to ensure that digital assets, such as data and software, are managed and shared in a way that maximizes their potential for reuse and impact. The importance of the FAIR principles lies in their ability to promote a culture of open science and data sharing. By adhering to these principles, academics and organizations can ensure that their digital assets are easy to find, accessible to a wide range of users, interoperable with other assets, and can be reused in a variety of contexts. The goal of this workshop then is an important one, remaining consistent through its various editions, i.e. to bring together leaders from academia, industry and user institutions to discuss the adoption of FAIR principles in real-world requirements as well as perspectives around challenges that lie therein.

[Sem4Tra](https://sem4tra2023.linkeddata.es/), the Semantic Data Spaces for Transport is back in its 5th edition at SEMANTICS. To achieve the Smart Cities' integrated and intelligent transportation system, you need to shift towards the Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) paradigm. However, the integration of different transportation services pursuing smart and sustainable mobility patterns must be addressed to realize its potential. Transportation companies and service providers are increasingly relying on a large set of interconnected devices and systems, therefore, it is extremely important to obtain and process interoperable data enabling new intelligent services for the citizens and data-driven decision-making. This workshop aims to advance MaaS through Semantic Web, Linked Data, and Knowledge Graph techniques, proposing new solutions to transform the transportation sector. In this scenario, many challenges arise such as how to align different data formats and specifications, how to handle decentralized data, how to effectively access and exploit transportation data on the web.

Last but not the least, comes our shiny new addition! NLP4KGC, having run a well-attended [1st edition](https://sites.google.com/view/nlp4kg) in conjunction with [the Web conference](https://www2023.thewebconf.org/), will host the 2nd edition of the [Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction](https://sites.google.com/view/2nd-nlp4kgc/home) (NLP4KGC) under the SEMANTiCS 2023 umbrella of workshops. In the context of the recent buzz in the AI community around Large Language Models (LLMs), which have reached astonishing scales, the importance of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Knowledge Graphs is even more pronounced. Can symbolic knowledge of KGs support generating even more knowledgeable LLMs? Have LLMs gotten so powerful that they can generate KGs from the ground-up without human intervention? Exploring these questions and more, this workshop invites contributions on methods and approaches of knowledge and data extraction from text, as well as theoretical and practical aspects of using semantic deep NLP for KG creation and the use of such symbolic KGs in graph or language neural models.

Now it's your turn! If you work on these topics, it is the right time to consider a submission! More details for each workshop can be found on the dedicated webpage. We look forward to welcoming you in Leipzig, Germany, via an enriching workshops program at SEMANTiCS 2023!
