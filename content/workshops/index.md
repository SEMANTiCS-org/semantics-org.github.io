### Outline
Making the resources produced by researchers fully reusable and understood requires specific efforts. The Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) principles were elaborated to address these issues, describing a set of requirements for resource reusability and interoperability. These principles have been gaining increasing attention in a range of different areas and applications. One the one hand, a key aspect is the ability of properly and semantically describing resources, in particular with the help of ontologies. On the other hand, ontologies themselves have to be compliant with the FAIR principles.  

This series of workshops has the following goals: (a) to bring together leaders from academia, industry and user institutions to discuss the adoption of FAIR principles in real-world requirements. (b) to serve to inform industry and user representatives about existing research efforts that may meet their requirements. (c) to investigate how the FAIR principles are supported by the use of schemes, vocabularies, and ontologies that ideally are themselves FAIR.%, including creation, reuse and alignment of schemas, vocabularies and ontologies, to support the FAIR principles and their adoption in diverse areas of application. (d) to discuss the challenges and perspectives in adopting FAIR principles.

### Outline
Integrated and intelligent transportation cannot be realized without a Mobility Data Space in which data flows. Such a Mobility Data Space improves every aspect of transportation from ticketing to navigation, from traffic to parking management and from car/bike sharing to door-to-door travel. This workshop seeks to advance Mobility Data Spaces targeting researchers and practitioners who are contributing to the transformation of the transportation sector using semantic technologies.

### Outline
Knowledge Graphs (KG) are emerging and becoming increasingly popular. Building a domain knowledge graph from a large amount of text requires a tremendous amount of work, including entity recognition, entity disambiguation and relationship extraction. Because of this, more work has been done on automated ways to generate knowledge graphs from text. Recent efforts in NLP (Natural Language Processing) development have shown that semantic deep neural networks can learn the complex syntactic and semantics of the natural language and thus, give more potential for automation even in the most complex domains i.e., legal documents. New approaches to KG development use a combination of extraction methods and state-of-the-art NLP techniques. Additionally, the advancement of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are able to learn powerful embeddings which leverage topological structures in the KGs and provide explanations of the outcome. Despite the successes this existing research has achieved, deep learning on graphs for NLP still faces many challenges. This workshop invites contributions on methods and approaches of knowledge and data extraction from text, as well as theoretical and practical aspects of Large Language Models, semantic deep NLP for KG creation and the use of such KG for Graph Neural Network GNN tasks.
