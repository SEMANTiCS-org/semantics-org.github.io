## Outline
Knowledge Graphs (KG) are emerging and becoming increasingly popular. Building a domain knowledge graph from a large amount of text requires a tremendous amount of work, including entity recognition, entity disambiguation and relationship extraction. Because of this, more work has been done on automated ways to generate knowledge graphs from text. Recent efforts in NLP (Natural Language Processing) development have shown that semantic deep neural networks can learn the complex syntactic and semantics of the natural language and thus, give more potential for automation even in the most complex domains i.e., legal documents. New approaches to KG development use a combination of extraction methods and state-of-the-art NLP techniques. Additionally, the advancement of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are able to learn powerful embeddings which leverage topological structures in the KGs and provide explanations of the outcome. Despite the successes this existing research has achieved, deep learning on graphs for NLP still faces many challenges. This workshop invites contributions on methods and approaches of knowledge and data extraction from text, as well as theoretical and practical aspects of Large Language Models, semantic deep NLP for KG creation and the use of such KG for Graph Neural Network GNN tasks.
