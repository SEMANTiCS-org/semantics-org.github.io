# Fifth International Workshop On A Semantic Data Space For Transport (Sem4Tra)

#### Organized by:
* *David Chaves Fraga (Senior Researcher, UPM & KULeuven)*
* *Mersedeh Sadeghi (Senior Researcher, University of Cologne)*
* *Shahrom Sohi (Researcher, WU)*
* *Juli√°n Rojas (Postdoc Researcher, imec - IDLab UGent)*

## Outline
Integrated and intelligent transportation cannot be realized without a Mobility Data Space in which data flows. Such a Mobility Data Space improves every aspect of transportation from ticketing to navigation, from traffic to parking management and from car/bike sharing to door-to-door travel. This workshop seeks to advance Mobility Data Spaces targeting researchers and practitioners who are contributing to the transformation of the transportation sector using semantic technologies.
