# Posters and Demos
The Posters & Demos Track provides a platform for researchers to showcase their latest findings, ongoing projects, and cutting-edge work in progress. These include submissions on innovative applications, latest results, unpublished ideas, prototypes of semantic technologies and their use in various domains as well as applications, use cases or pieces of code that may attract developers and potential research or business partners. This also concerns new datasets made publicly available.  
The Posters & Demos Track offers an informal setting that promotes engagement and dialogue between presenters and attendees. These discussions can provide valuable feedback for presenters' future work, while also allowing participants to gain insight into emerging research trends and network with other researchers.

## Important dates
* **Paper Submission Deadline**: June 20, 2023 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)
* **Notification of Acceptance**: July 20, 2023 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)
* **Camera-Ready Paper Deadline**: August 15, 2023 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)

**Submission via Easychair on https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sem23**. Proceedings of SEMANTiCS 2023 EU will be made available open access by CEUR-WS.org.

## Topics of Interest
We welcome contributions in the context of semantic-based research and systems,
which address – but are not limited to – the topics of the [Research Track](/page/cfp_rev_rep). Additionally, we encourage submissions of visionary ideas, position statements, negative results, and unconventional ideas.  

Demos should showcase innovative implementations and technologies both, from academia and industry. We also very much encourage submissions from industry, but they should be focused on presenting a novel solution to a specific problem and not be in the nature of an advertisement or commercial product description.

## Author Guidelines and Submission
Poster and demo submissions should consist of a paper that describes the work, its contribution to the field or innovative aspects.

* Poster and demo submissions are at most 5 pages long, including references.
* No double-blind submissions required.
* Submissions must be either in PDF or HTML.
* Submissions must be formatted in the style of CEUR-ART (https://ceur-ws.org/HOWTOSUBMIT.html). An Overleaf page for LaTeX users is available.
* For demos, we ask authors to include links enabling the reviewers to test the application or review the component. The absence of a pointer affects the overall rating of the contribution.
* Submissions must be original and must not have been submitted for publication elsewhere.
* At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper.


## Clarification on Large Language Model Policy  
In this regard, we as organizers of SEMANTICS 2023, follow the guidelines of the community about the fair use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and borrow the policy from the International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management 2023. The policy is for all tracks of the conference and indicated Papers that include text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, are prohibited unless the produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis. In essence, the policy expects the following:

* The Large Language Model (LLM) policy for SEMANTICS 2023 prohibits text produced entirely by LLMs (i.e., “generated”). This does not prohibit authors from using LLMs for editing or polishing the author-written text.  
* The LLM policy is largely predicated on the principle of being conservative with respect to guarding against potential issues of using LLMs, including plagiarism.  
* The LLM policy applies to SEMANTICS 2023. We expect this policy to evolve in future conferences as we better understand LLMs and their impacts on scientific publishing.
