# DBpedia Day 2023
SEMANTiCS 2023 will host the **DBpedia Day** in Leipzig, Germany.  

## Community Meeting
[DBpedia](https://www.dbpedia.org/) is an international crowd-sourced community effort to extract structured information from Wikipedia, Wikidata and Wikimedia Commons and to make this information available on the Web as Linked Open Data.  
 
DBpedia provides tools that allow you to create, maintain, improve, integrate and use KGs to build applications, e.g. BBC has created the World Cup 2010 website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base. Data provided by DBpedia was greatly involved in creating this knowledge graph.  

DBpedia has become a high-impact, high-visibility project because of our foundation in excellent Knowledge Engineering as the pivot point between scientific methods, innovation and industrial-grade output. The drivers behind DBpedia are 4 out of the [TOP 10 Most Influential Scholars](https://www.aminer.org/ai2000/ke) in Knowledge Engineering and the C-level executives of our members.

## This year's topics
Linking and Consumption of Linked Data â€“ Since 2007, DBpedia has been the hub of the Linked Open Data Cloud, the largest constantly updating knowledge graph on Earth using Linked Data principles.

By following the 62 million links published alongside the 6.5 million identifiers of the DBpedia Snapshot (https://www.dbpedia.org/blog/dbpedia-snapshot-2022-03-release/), our users could discover and consume more data from the web. Now in 2023, 16 years after the first release, we developed a way to scale up our identifier base into the billions to provide the glue for better linking and consumption of linked data. The main topics of the DBpedia Day will be twofold:  
1. We would like to ask our industrial and academic members as well as the wider community to present the latest technology to discover, query, link, curate and consume Linked Data and Knowledge Graphs.  
2. We will introduce the Linkmaster 3000 (the new Open Online Link Curation Platform), the Global LD API, the Databus and the Global LD Browser to gather feedback.

## Highlights include
* Keynote presentations 
* DBpedia Databus presentation
* DBpedia member presentation
* DBpedia Community session
