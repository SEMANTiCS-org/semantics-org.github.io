# Industry & Use Case Presentations
The Industry & Use Case track at SEMANTiCS welcomes submissions that present use cases and industry adoption of semantic technology. Solutions that deal with semantic processing of data and/or information in areas like Linked Data, Knowledge Graphs, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Publishing, Thesaurus and/or Ontology management, and any related fields. All submissions have a strong focus on real world applications beyond the prototypical status and demonstrate the power of semantic systems!

## Important dates
* **Submission ___extended___ Deadline**: ~~May 30~~ <span style="color:red">June 13</span>, 2023 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)
* **Notification of Acceptance**: June 28, 2023 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)
* **Presentation Ready**: August 15, 2023 (11:59 pm, Hawaii time)  

**Submission via Easychair on https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sem23**. Please notice that a paper abstract is not necessary, as your submission will only include a presentation at SEMANTiCS and not a paper. Please do supply a description of the case you want to present, in particular: initial situation, approach, business value and benefits of the semantic solution, prospects and recommendation.

## Topics of Interest
SEMANTiCS 2023 especially invites contributions that target the following main topics, sub-topics in the context of semantic-based research and systems as well as applicative domains.  

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Application of Semantically Enriched and AI-Based Approaches:
* Knowledge Graphs in Bioinformatics and Medical AI
* Clinical Use Case of AI-based Approaches
* AI for Environmental Challenges  
* Semantics in Scholarly Communication and Open Research Knowledge Graphs
* AI and LOD within GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums) institutions

## Author Guidelines and Submission
* This call for presentations reaches out to professionals in the areas related to the topics of SEMANTiCS for proposals to present industry implementations, best practices and use case prototypes, to discuss semantic systems in birds-of-a-feather sessions as well as informal settings. Additionally, we explicitly encourage the submission of software applications, apps or services that demonstrate the usefulness and benefits of semantic technologies and semantic data management.  
* An industry and use case presentation allows your organisation or project to advance and promote your topics and gain increased visibility. It gives you the chance to network with experts in a variety of fields. These relationships provide great value to organisations as they encounter subtle technical issues in any stage of implementation. The expertise gained by SEMANTiCS attendees has a long-term impact on their careers and organisations. These factors make SEMANTiCS for our community the major industry related event across Europe.
* To contribute a submission for a presentation at SEMANTiCS 2022 please prepare the following: Fill out the online application at Easychair ([https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sem23](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sem23)) and give us relevant information about your expertise and your professional background. (Please note: Only fully completed forms can be accepted!). In case of inquiries please do not hesitate to contact us: [industry@semantics.cc](mailto:industry@semantics.cc)  
* All accepted submissions will be granted a presentation slot of **30 minutes (25 min. Presentation + 5 min. Discussion)**. Please stick to this time pattern when preparing your talk. This is the only way we can guarantee a smooth and satisfying programme and allow all conference participants to attend as many slots as possible without missing important information.

Please take care to address the following aspects in your talk:
* Initial Situation  
What kind of challenge did you face in the beginning of the project? What problems  needed to be solved?
Approach and IT-Solution
* Approach and IT-Solution  
Which approach and methodology has been chosen to tackle the problem(s)? How is your solution composed with respect to technological aspects / human aspects / organisational aspects? How do the semantic components support the process from data to knowledge?
* Success Criteria for / Benefit of the Semantic Solution  
Which factors (conscious and unconscious) have been crucial to the success of your project? Which obstacles did you face? How can you measure the benefit of your solution? How does the organisation benefit from your solution?  
* Prospects and Recommendations  
What are the next steps planned in your project? Can you give recommendations with respect to development / deployment of semantic solutions within organisational / corporate settings?  
* Demo (if applicable)  
Prepare a short demonstration of your tool / service.

## Review and Evaluation Criteria
Every submission will be reviewed by the Programme Committee.  

Papers submitted to this track will be evaluated according to the following criteria:  
* Your presentation is relevant to industry and industrial purposes. It illustrates how semantic technologies / solutions contribute to or improve existing businesses and / or generate new ones.
* The presented solution has already been deployed and / or has been tested in a practical environment – at least prototypically.
* Your presentation is well-structured and does bring across its message.
* The topic is well described and covers enough explanations, examples, use cases, graphics, etc.
* Novelty: The topic covered is new to your industry – not necessarily new to business in general  

In case your presentation will be accepted, we will provide you with detailed information on organisational matters according to the selection of submissions and conference participation.

## Your Benefit
Presenters will be granted access to the entire program of the SEMANTiCS Conference (incl. all social events) at a reduced rate. Additionally, presenters will have the possibility to discuss their contributions with an interested audience and exchange ideas on how semantic technologies can be utilized for corporate and business needs more effectively and successfully. Besides that, the Industry Presentations at SEMANTiCS generate a high visibility within the Semantics Community and allow you to meet interesting experts and extend your business network.  

We are looking forward to your contribution!  


## Clarification on Large Language Model Policy  
In this regard, we as organizers of SEMANTICS 2023, follow the guidelines of the community about the fair use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and borrow the policy from the International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management 2023. The policy is for all tracks of the conference and indicated Papers that include text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, are prohibited unless the produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis. In essence, the policy expects the following:

* The Large Language Model (LLM) policy for SEMANTICS 2023 prohibits text produced entirely by LLMs (i.e., “generated”). This does not prohibit authors from using LLMs for editing or polishing the author-written text.  
* The LLM policy is largely predicated on the principle of being conservative with respect to guarding against potential issues of using LLMs, including plagiarism.  
* The LLM policy applies to SEMANTICS 2023. We expect this policy to evolve in future conferences as we better understand LLMs and their impacts on scientific publishing.
